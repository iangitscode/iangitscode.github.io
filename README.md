Hi! This is a soccer juggling game I wrote in vanilla Javascript based on Facebook Messenger's version of it. Simply click the ball to kick it. All code was written by me, and this project represents the current cumulation of my HTML/CSS/JS knowledge.

It is worth noting that this game was intended to be played using a touchscreen computer, although it is still playable using a mouse.
